<img width="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/pranavpedd/Personal-Portfolio/assets/87783549/fc919bbc-7269-463c-8144-20a049140514">

This repo is where you'll find the source code for my personal website, which is a showcase of my skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, EJS, Node.js, and Express.js. It's a full-on display of what I can do, covering everything from my skill set and work experience to a bunch of personal projects, with this website being a standout example. It's not just about showing off my technical skills, though â€“ it's also a neat summary of my journey and accomplishments in software development.

Feel free to reach out as I would be more than happy to hear any feedback regarding areas of improvement!
